- application
  - logging with standard logging and python-json-logger
  - configuration with standard configparser, python-dotenv and pydantic
  - command line with Typer
  - web service with FastAPI, Uvicorn and Gunicorn
- deployment with Docker images
  - development image based on `python:latest`
  - lightweight production image based on `python:slim` using multi-stage build
- Make formula for common development tasks
  - install dependencies
  - run continuous integration tasks
  - run application
  - build Docker images

## Usage

Clone this repository or [use it as a template][generate] to generate a new repository.

Update the project name and metadata in `pyproject.toml` and `configs/main.ini`.

### External dependencies

- [Conda][conda]
- [Docker][docker]
- [Make][make]

### Create environment

Use Conda to create a virtual environment and activate it for the project.

```bash
PROJECT_NAME = python-project-template
PYTHON_VERSION = 3.7

conda create --name $PROJECT_NAME --yes python=$PYTHON_VERSION
conda activate $PROJECT_NAME
```

### Install dependencies

Install Poetry with pip. Then install project dependencies with Poetry.

```bash
make deps-install
```

Use Poetry to add project and development dependencies into `pyproject.toml`.

NOTE: Poetry must be included as a development dependency to prevent
Poetry from uninstalling its own dependencies.

```bash
# development dependency
poetry add --dev poetry

# project dependency
poetry add pydantic
```
